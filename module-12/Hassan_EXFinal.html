                    <p>Manga refers to an entire industry of graphic novels originating from Japan. Spanning as many genres as novels, there is an option for every type of reader. Recently, manga has become a part of the American Zeitgeist as anime, the animated counterpart also originating from Japan, has grown in popularity.</p>
                    <p>After watching the Naruto anime, I started reading manga when I was twelve. Since then, I have continued to read manga, reading at least two hundred chapters a month. Anyone who is a fan of an expansive medium, such as music or film, will know that there are constant arguments about who has the best opinions. Among consumers of manga and anime, a common phrase is that everyone has "trash taste."</p>
                    <p>The application I use the most for reading manga is VIZ Manga which provides users with one hundred chapters a day and a catalog of hundreds of manga for only $1.99 a month. If you are alright with violence and adult themes, Chainsaw Man and The Promised Neverland are two series available on VIZ Manga that I recommend.</p>

                    <p>The term podcast refers to a wide variety of content, originally a portmanteau of iPod and broadcast, podcast evolved from the audioblogs of the early internet. From this lineage, traditionally podcasts consist of people communicating about a topic. However, some podcasts escape the blog format and opt for storytelling elements following in the shoes of Howard Koch's The War of the Worlds radio drama.</p>       
                    <p>Growing up, I listened to a lot of books on tape and talk radio, especially when on family trips. The first podcast I seeked out on my own was a production of a small internet company, the Rooster Teeth podcast. Today, whenever I am free to listen to an audio medium, such as when driving or exercising, I choose to listen to a podcast.</p>
                    <p>Spotify and Apple podcasts are the most common applications for listening by numbers; however, I became attached to Google podcasts as it came preloaded on my Pixel and I am not a fan of Spotify. I spend a majority of my listening time on Behind the Bastards and related shows from CoolZoneMedia, but I also listen to many of the podcasts in the RT family, but my favorite of those is F**kface.</p>

                    <p>Magic the Gathering is a trading card game released in the fall of 1993, originally designed as a card game version of dungeons & dragons by its developer Richard Garfield. By consistently releasing expansion sets of cards every year since release, the overall card pool has grown to over twenty thousand. With this many options to choose from, the relative complexity of the game is constantly increasing, making it a haven for problem solving and experimentation. The process of making a deck is traditionally called brewing and the act of playing is called piloting.</p>
                    <p>I was introduced to Magic by a cousin at around ten years old, but didn't grasp the concepts as they were older and didn't sit down to explain it. In the summer of 2007, I met my closest friend to this day and they introduced me to the game properly. The intricacies of brewing and piloting instantly hooked me, and I found myself purchasing and playing in much of my free time.</p>
                    <p>I stopped playing with actual paper cards, as the game is costly, and started playing the digital Magic Arena in 2017 starting during the closed beta testing. Starting out can seem difficult as you lack access to powerful cards unless you spend a lot of money; however, Arena provides an in-game currency for playing and free cards to start with.</p>

                    <p>To fit the twists and turns of my college courses, I use delivery applications to make ends meet. Because my vehicle is electric, the cost of mileage is lower than an internal combustion vehicle. I officially started during the pandemic, when deliveries were necessary for many and found it was a good fit for my current life. While the gig economy does not provide workers with anything in terms of social safety nets, I enjoy being able to set my own hours and work at the pace I want to. I will commonly stay close to Costco, as the deliveries are higher payout per time than others and listen to podcasts the entire time.</p>

                    <p>As a temporary worker for a staffing agency, I worked as a student loan servicer for the organization Nelnet. Centered out of Lincoln Nebraska, Nelnet is one of the primary loan servicers for the federal student loan program. To service modern loan accounts, I had to go through a specific government clearance process including a one-on-one interview with an FBI agent. This process involved having a separate reference for every job I worked and every place of residence I had in the last seven years.</p>

                    <p>Subway has always existed as my stop-gap job, as most everywhere I could move to in the world has at least one Subway. I have worked at several levels at this sandwich chain, from developing task lists and training regiments to general management of a store, giving me the ability to slot into management if I have troubles finding employment in a new city. While I don't think I will ever return to Subway, I have fond memories of working there and even though I ate there multiple times a week for several years, I could still eat there today.</p>
